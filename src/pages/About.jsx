        This app tracks your todo list items. To do so, type your task into the
        text box and hit "Add todo." The tasks can be edited by clicking on the
        text. Once a task has been completed, hitting the check box next to the
        task will delete the task from the list. The tasks can also be sorted
        alphabetically and by the time it was created.
