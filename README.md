This app is simply called 'todo-list,' and its objective is very simple: display a list of things you want accomplished.

To run the app, you would need to first download this repository onto your local hard drive.

Once that is done, if you would like to run the development server, you would need to:

    - Open the terminal
    - Navigate to the repository's path
    - Type "npm run dev"

The above three steps will then run the site on your device!
